# Getting started

Conda root environment requirements
```
  conda update conda
  conda install conda-env conda-build anaconda-client
  anaconda login
```
Use your personal Anaconda.org account, make sure you have at least read access to the clinicalgraphics channel.

# Development environment
```
  `cd {checkout_dir}`
  `conda env create` or `conda env update` if you already have a checkout and you've pulled changes
  `activate {environment_name}`
```
Happy developing!
